        <p>The annual bonused index interest rates shown below are determined by applying the current (nonguaranteed) caps and participation rates to the most recent 25 full calendar years of
                historical index performance. For the Bloomberg US Dynamic Balance Index II, Allianz True BalanceSM, and PIMCO Tactical Balanced Index, the values shown reflect the longest common
                periods of historical data available for each of the indexes that comprise the Bloomberg US Dynamic Balance Index II, Allianz True BalanceSM, and PIMCO Tactical Balanced Index. The rates
                shown assume that the product, index, and allocation options were available during the time period shown.
                Keep in mind that past performance is not a prediction of future results. Different time periods and different indexes will produce higher or lower rates. Also, caps and participation rates
                are subject to change on any policy anniversary</p>
